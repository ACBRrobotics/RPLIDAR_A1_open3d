# RPLIDAR_A1_open3d
A simple python script integrating the RPLIDAR A1 LiDAR with the open3d point cloud library.  The live LiDAR data is read, visualized in an open3d window.  The point cloud data is then analyzed to find the point in the point cloud nearest to the lidar, and it's angle and distance from the LiDAR is measured.
