This robot chassis is meant to serve as a general-purpose platform to mount various single-board computers including the LattePanda Delta 3, the Raspberry Pi 4B, and the Nvidia Jetson Nano onto a mobile robot platform.  The chassis also contains the hole pattern need to mount the CYTRON MDD10A motor driver, and the RPLIDAR A1 LiDAR onto the robot. 
 The chassis is small enough to be used indoors, but large enough to be used outdoors as well.  The pieces are designed to be cut from 3mm acrylic but can be altered to be used with a wide range of materials.  To complete the build, feel free to follow the BOM to obtain the rest of the necessary components. For more information regarding the project please refer to the academic paper located in the repository.
