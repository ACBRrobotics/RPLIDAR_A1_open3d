This robot chassis is meant to serve a general purpose platform to mount various single board computers, a motor driver, and the RPLIDAR A1 LiDAR onto a robot chassis that is small enough to be used indoors, but large enough to be used outdoors as well.  The peices are designed to be cut from 3mm acyrlic, but can be altered to be used with a wide range of materials.  To complete the build, feel free to follow the BOM to obtain the rest of the necessary components.
